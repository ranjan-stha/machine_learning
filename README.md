Implementation of ML Classification algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of varioud ML Classification algorithms along with the elements required to do the performance evaluaion such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC and AUC.

These classification algorithms are based on scikit learn package, so, you need to have it if you want to run them locally.

For the Feedforward Neural Network, the MNIST digit classifier is implemented using pytorch. The required packages descriptions are presented in the file itself.

Note: If you are not able to view the jupyter python notebook in the github itself, you can copy-paste the link in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org

The implementation of the classifiers are based on freely available datasets
kNN - iris dataset
ANN - MNIST digit (0-9) dataset
Decision Trees - Breast Cancer dataset
Naive Bayes - Play golf dataset (available in the repository)
